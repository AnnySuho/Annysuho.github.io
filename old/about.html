prospective classes for 2020 fall are not set yet as i have to force request into them because i technically have yet to enter to a major. more on that.
my plans for the summer other than finishing this webpage is to take on other related personal projects related to computer science. i may be taking some summer classes (not too sure yet).
i am expected to start my internship at HP on 2020/05/18 so maybe ill write about that here. again there is a lot of sht that i need to unload on this webpage so this project is going to take quite a while (hopefully summer 2020).

right here i will write about some of the trouble i encountered while building this webpage. i bought a domain way back and it was a .cn. unfortunately i did not
send documents in a time frame so that domain got suspended. so unfortunately for the time being i have to use github's website hosting to do this. the end goal is to still use github to host but "forward" (if thats even the right word; im a noob when it comes to network stuff) it to annysuho.cn.
